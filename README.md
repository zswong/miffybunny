Overview of the project: The webpage I've created using Github pages is my intended personal portfolio that I will continue updating and improving. Different sections of my personal portfolio include an about me section, an experience section, a fun section, and a contact section. The purpose of this webpage is for me to keep track of my future work and projects. Hopefully it will become something I'm proud of, and be able to show recruiters when I start seeking for interships/jobs.

The wireframe for my web pagecan be found in: images/Webpage_wireframe.png

technology stack used to develop the website:

HTML was used for structuring the content of the webpage.
CSS was used for styling and formatting the visual presentation of the website.
The MIT license was chosen for my repository because it is the license that I am most familiar with. Moreover, the MIT license has many benefits. Due to MIT license's permissiveness, it allows permission for users to reuse code for any purpose. As long as users include the the MIT license in their distribution, they can make modifications to the code to suit their own needs. It is beneficial for community developers and teams that want to produce propriety software using existing pieces of MIT licensed code. Thus, I think it is a suitable license for my repository as it provides more flexibility.
